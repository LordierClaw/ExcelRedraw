# ExcelRedraw_Image_NotOptimized
If you just want to redraw a single picture in excel.

This script isn't optimized for performance.

It uses openpyxl in full mode so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

# ExcelRedraw_Video_Optimized
-Each frame picture will be 'render' and draw in a worksheet (500 frames -> 500 worksheets). This script doesn't contain any function like exporting all the frames of your video. You have to do it by yourself (you can use Adobe Premiere)

-Due to the lack ability of "write_only" mode in openpyxl, the cells are not 'perfect squares'. You should use macro to modify them instead.

-Best Performance, your potato pc can run it smoothly with over 5000+ images

-I did an example with Bad Apple MV: https://youtu.be/aKTGgZ32UuM
